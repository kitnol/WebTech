                        Welcome, dear visitor! <br><br>
                        We are five humble Mechatronics students, currently in our 5th semester at SDU, carrying forth the
                        proud tradition of building websites.
                        <br><br>
                        Our specialty? A fine little music player website, lovingly handcrafted for your listening pleasure.
                        Here, you may not only enjoy the sweet sounds of your favorite tracks, but also bring your own!
                        <br><br>
                        This whole venture is part of the prestigious course “Web Technologies 2025”, where we perfect the
                        art of turning late-night coffee and questionable code into a proper website.
                        <br><br>
                        Please, make yourself at home!
